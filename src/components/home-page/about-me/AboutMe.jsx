                I studied at California Polytechnic State University, San Luis
                Obispo. I started off as a mechanical engineer in September 2015
                and later switched to computer science my junior year. I
                graduated in March 2020 with a 3.93/4.00 GPA.

                In 2014, I worked alongside 2 MIT professors that involved
                research on manipulating sound waves with code using an iPad's
                internal gyroscope as well as Swift during its beta phase.

                I played violin when I was 4 years old, and for every grade
                since 4th grade through college, I was concertmaster and a
                soloist (Achieved the last Advanced Level in Certificate of
                Merit).
